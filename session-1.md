## Money



### Currency

- Currency as a store of value
- Currency as a medium of exchange



### Properties of Money 

- Durable: can survie over time
- Divisible: can be split evenly
- Fungibility: Any note is always equivalent and exchangeable to another
- Portability: Able to be taken around
  - Bearer instrument (cash): not portable for larrge amounts or long distances
  - Registered instrument (electronic cash): more portable
    - Someone must be responsible for the responsible transfer of cash (custodian)



### Problems and Concerns

- if someone has the capability of mismanagement, why wouldn't they. Particularly if they can do it anonymously.
- Double spending: what prevents me from spending the same money twice





## Why Blockchain

Solve the double spend through a distributed ledger.

Bearer (owner) of private key and thus the money behind it.



### Distributed systems

- Struggle with concurrency
  - Concurrency solved with consensus mechanisms
  - Generally necessary to have an incentive (and disincentives) system. Side note: [51% attack](https://hackernoon.com/51-attacks-and-the-future-of-pow-402266905bfa), [consensus algorithms](https://hackernoon.com/a-hitchhikers-guide-to-consensus-algorithms-d81aae3eb0e3)



- Struggle with scalability
  - Smart consensus can alleviate this: see Proof of Stake
